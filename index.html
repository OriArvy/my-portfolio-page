        <a href="https://www.repaythedelay.com"><h1>Repay The Delay 🚅</h1></a>
        <p>Repay The Delay is a mobile first web-app to check your delayed trains and claim quick and easy refunds. This was build as the final project of my 9 week coding bootcamp. I worked with 3 other people on this project. It took us 10 days to build. Technologies and skills used in this project: Figma, Trello, Kitt (Le Wagons tool for creating Database schema), Github, Heroku, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, ES6 Javascript, CSS, SCSS, HTML and Bootstrap.</p>

        <a href="https://www.venue-menu-m.herokuapp.com"><h1>Venue Menu 🏯</h1></a>
        <p>This was the first group project that I worked on during my bootcamp. It is an AirBnb clone where you can book your perfect venue from our generous menu. I worked with 3 other people on this project. This project took us 5 days to develop. Technologies and skills used for this product were the same as for Repay The Delay. This was my favourite project to work on. It was a lot of fun and I personally feel like I learned a lot more from this project than any other project.</p>

      <h1 class="greeting">Lets start with some music that I enjoy</h1>
      <p>Just like most people I do enjoy a variaty of music genres. Also just like for most of us mood plays a big part in what songs I feel like listening to. Here is a small 10 song playlist of songs that I currently enjoy.</p>

      <h1 class="about-me">Hobbies</h1>
      <p>During my free time I tend to mostly enjoy playing video games. Unfortunately for me in the past 3-4 months I couldn't play too many games since I've been busy with Le Wagon and job search. But I am certain I will come back to playing games very soon! Besides playing video games I also love esports. One of the biggest esports events is currently ongoing which is - League of Legends World Championship. I am super excited to watch it this year and I am sure it will not disappoint! Besides that I also tend to sometimes check on some regular sports like football or basketball, but I only enjoy watching them during the international tournaments as I enjoy those the most. I also recently started cooking, but I am very bad at it so it's not very rewarding just yet. But I am sure one day I will make Gordon Ramsay proud! Since I recently got into coding I guess you can add that to my hobby list as I will be trying to get better at it and have my fun by build some fun and enjoyable websites in the near future.</p>
